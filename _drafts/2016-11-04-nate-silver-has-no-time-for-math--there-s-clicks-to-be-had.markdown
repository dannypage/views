  #### 4 more days. 4 more days. Whoosah. Whoosah.

*Article updated at 2016/11/05 12:30 AM EDT, thanks to *[*Peter Owen*](http://_PeteOwen)* on Twitter for some correction with the math. Moves Trump from 6%->12.3% chance having a favorable polling error.*

At 2016/11/04 12:22 PM EDT, FiveThirtyEight’s Polls-Only had Clinton leading by the following numbers: Clinton 48.5– Trump 45.2, putting Clinton up 3.3%. These numbers are adjusted by their trendline calculation; the [baseline polling puts Clinton up 4.9 points](https://twitter.com/nataliemjb/status/794595840862064640). But for the purposes of this article, we’ll use their numbers to show that it’s still not THAT close.

Harry Enten has [calculated the average polling error from the last 12 Presidential Elections](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-just-a-normal-polling-error-behind-clinton/). Putting aside how polling has changed in the last 50 years and small sample size (More recent Senate polling numbers are probably closer to present-day polling than Nixon’s election), he came up with the following:


> On average, the polls have been off by 2 percentage points, whether because the race moved in the final days or because the polls were simply wrong.So, we have Clinton up by around 3.3 points. The average error in Presidential public polling is 2.0 points. So what’s going on here?


> [](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/794571867449421829)please, please stop with this![](/views/assets/img/1*xYKyKt_IfapFP5f7GOcxbQ.png)<http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-just-a-normal-polling-error-behind-clinton/>First, Nate must be mentioning the standard deviation, not the average absolute error. That should have been communicated better.

Second, 3-point polling errors do not happen “pretty often”. They have happened 3 times. 1980, 1996, 2000. I can be charitable and give you 2012 by rounding up. That’s 4 out of 12.

Third, the headline appears “Trump Is Just A Normal Polling Error Behind Clinton” to be incorrect as well. If they are using ‘Normal’ to mean a normal distribution, [we can measure](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%5B0.5,1.8,0.8,-7.2,-1,1.4,-0.1,-3.3,3.4,-0.9,-0.3,2.7%5D) the standard deviation of that distribution. The standard deviation of the errors is 2.84. The lead is not yet a Normal polling error quite yet. A 3.3 or greater movement in either direction happens just 24.6 percent of the time.

However, these random errors also include the possibility that Clinton doubles her lead on Election Day. So we have to measure in one direction that gives Trump more votes, not less. Given historic polling errors that 538 provided and the current polling lead, [**Trump bypasses Clinton only 12.3% of the time**](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=normal+distribution,+mean%3D0,+sd%3D2.854,+X%3C-3.3)**.**

The race may be closer, especially with increased variance in this election. But given historical results, it would still be remarkable if polling is wrong in Trump’s favor by 3+ points. This also assume that 538’s trendline calculation is correct, and perhaps the lead is even greater. However, it is do-able. It is possible! But I don’t think it is right to call a “pretty often” occurrence and say it’s within the margin, especially when standard deviations may not be all that well understood.

That said, if it did make you nervous as a Clinton supporter, go vote!
