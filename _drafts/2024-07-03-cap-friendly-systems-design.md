I've interviewed for many Software Engineer roles that put a heavy emphasis on [Systems Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_design#Web_System_design). In our roles as full-stack engineers, part of the job is knowing how the whole system fits togther. Perhaps you can write really efficient code and solve LeetCode problems, but can you explain how different applications should interact? What should the database schema look like?
