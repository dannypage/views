  ![](/views/assets/img/1*DOM17ZsgQe0I29Tu1RaKdw.jpeg)DC United has had a very interesting tenure under Ben Olsen. In his four full seasons, two times they have been at the top of the Eastern Conference. Twice they have been near or at the bottom of the league. It’s been bewildering being a fan as we never know what to expect from the team.

2015 appears to have DC United aiming for the top spot again. DCU was first in MLS for multiple weeks, which has been fantastic for morale and attendance. But as in anything, life’s tough at the top. First, they lost in Philly 1–0 to a stoppage time goal. Soon after, they needed the Revs to go down to 9 men to finally convert their singular Shot-On-Goal for a 1–1 draw. And lastly, they took a reserve squad to Portland and lost 1–0 (It could have been worse, if not for Hamid doing Hamid things). 8 weeks in, and DC United now sits (uncomfortably) at the top of the East, and a point behind Seattle.

DCU got off to a great start, but they are failing to separate from the pack. The biggest disappointment in these last 3 efforts is that a single goal in each would have been equivalent to a Mario Kart Golden Mushroom in the Supporters’ Shield race. (Taptaptaptaptap) Instead, they keep tossing bananas ahead and then running straight into them.

So, where will this team go? MLS is notoriously tricky with a very even parity, and United could easily end up winning the league; alternatively if this bad run continues, they could drop out of the playoffs. Here are some of the factors that I think will impact the team in the remaining 20 games:

### The Good

#### Bill Hamid

DC United has benefited greatly from Bill Hamid. I’d posit he’s been the primary reason that this club has had a chance every year for the last 4 years. Over his career 10,000 MLS minutes, his presence in net equals 0.2 less goals conceded than the average goalkeeper. While that’s small on a per game basis, it’s a huge effect per season. In 2014, he was worth 7 prevented goals over the average GK. This likely translated into the 4 points needed to win the East. The team hopes he continues this above-average trend as they recently gave him a nice contract extension to keep him in DC.

#### The Easy East

2015 brought NYCFC and Orlando City SC to the league. Those expansions and Chivas USA folding meant that the league needed to rebalance the conferences. Sporting KC and Houston Dynamo, two of the best teams in the East for the last 5 years, went to the Western Conference. This move has made things a lot easier for the top incumbents. 5 teams in the East sport a 1.2 or worse Points Per Game average, including NYCFC’s horrid 0.58 PPG over 12 games. Meanwhile in the West, only Colorado Rapids is under 1.2 (13 points in 12 games). Therefore, look for DC United, NYRB, and New England Revolution to try to feast on these weaker clubs in-conference. If DC United’s loss to Philly was a fluke, they should manage rack up some easy points as soon as this Saturday, which will help to get them back on track.

#### Banked Points

![](/views/assets/img/1*KxkwoQuKj_02rrqvn8DGPQ.png)New England benefitted from the early lead.In 2014, New England was in first in the East with 20 points after 12 matches (Sounds similar!). Then, they lost 8 straight times and eventually found themselves 7th in the standings. Fortunately for NER, they regained their form and went 10–2–2 over their last 14 matches to retake 2nd in the conference. Could DC United weather a smaller storm and still make a run at the shield? It’s possible, as many teams didn’t take this opportunity to build a stable lead in points. But it would also require a dominant effort in the back half of the season as well (More on this later).

### The Bad

#### Packed Schedule

After this Saturday’s game, DC United will have played 14 matches in 3 months. This mark is tied with 6 other teams and one match behind LA Galaxy’s 15 matches. They've been quite busy, but unfortunately for this exhausted team, there’s no break for them. DC & LA will both have played 20 matches by the end of June, for a match every ~5.5 days. This is a brutal scheduling problem, and specifically for DC, the team has a glaring lack of depth (ESPN reports they have one of the cheapest roster’s in the league). Washington is a humid city, but June could be a very dry month for United. All of the opponents are in the East, and every exhausted loss they suffer is an bigger deal than merely giving up points to the teams in the West.

#### Anemic Offense

**DC United Rankings (Per Game):**

Goals: 1.08 — 12th (Tied)  
Shots: 10.08 — 19th  
Shots on Target: 3.62 — 14th (Tied)  
Expected Goals*: 1.05 — 16th

I'm not sure where the attacking prowess is going to come from. The one answer might be that they haven't had a full complement of all their top strikers with injuries, illness, and suspensions. Their replacements have not been clicking together either. This is a team that needs multiple people to step up and produce some shots and goals, but so far that hasn't happened. Supporters’ Shield could be in sight, but only if they improve those numbers.

### The Unknown

#### Summer Transfer Window

The team will most likely be involved in the International Transfer Window. The question remains whether they will be a buyer or a seller. Perry Kitchen and Bill Hamid could see a move in their future to Europe, which would really shine a spotlight on DC’s defensive issues. Alternatively, getting relief from Eddie Johnson’s salary might allow the team to make some moves. If they are able to get the interest of a decent striker, there’s hope that the offense could be clicking together in time for the playoffs.

#### Other Teams’ Performance

As noted with the New England Revolution example, other teams may not step up and take a huge points lead. If DC United doesn't fall too far behind in June, they could used the lighter schedule in the second half of the season to make up those lost points. But if Seattle maintains their 1.92 PPG (Average Shield winner: 1.90 PPG), it would require a blistering winning pace in the latter months.

### Final Words

DC United has some good pieces. Olsen appears to be a great “Player’s Coach”. Hamid, Kitchen, and Rolfe are consistent parts of the team that have been instrumental to the success of the team so far. But there are still a lot of issues with this team that haven't been figured out, whether they be internal or external. Leading the league was a nice moment, but it’s a very long season, and the whole of the team will be tested in the coming month. The Supporters’ Shield is a very tough award to earn and winning it isn't easy. Getting through June and remembering how to score are completely necessary towards those goals.

P.S. I'll be diving deeper into some of more technical aspects of United’s metrics in the upcoming months, including Hamid’s amazing skill, which of the young guns is the future of this team, and looking into the idea that team in need of a better tactical direction. I also will be updating [my MLS season simulator](http://cynical.futbol/mls_season_sim/2014) to give a better of this team’s future. Hope you'll follow along!
