  Soccer fans love to compare their favorite tournament to other tournaments, and The Times Is On It: [“Euro Soccer: Just as Good as the World Cup, if Not Better”](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/15/upshot/euro-soccer-just-as-good-as-the-world-cup-if-not-better.html?smid=tw-upshotnyt&smtyp=cur&_r=0).

The author uses 6 metrics to use as yardsticks to determine quality of the game. This may be similar to Excitement Indices used in other sports, but there’s no weighting used here. It includes: Margin of Victory (smaller is better), Goals Scored, Total Shots, Successful Passes, Successful Passes in Attacking Third, and Shots per Possession. Goals and Shot metrics are reasonable for these purposes, but passes? I’d wager pass percentage would have been better than raw totals. But let’s move on to the analysis:


> Anyone who has ever said the Euros can easily match the World Cup can give themselves a tiny pat on the back, although there is **no indication** that they are significantly better.Uh oh. Shame on the headline writer (likely not the author’s fault). “Euro Soccer: Just as Good as the World Cup, **if Not Better**” ? Hmm.


> Comparing five-tournament averages for the Euros (1996 through 2012) and the World Cup (1998 through 2014) shows **almost no difference on four of these measures**. Passing accuracy was almost identical, with the Euros having 623 successful passes per game on average, versus 634 for the World Cup. In the Euros, 2.42 goals per game were scored, against 2.45 in the World Cup. In both competitions, there was on average 28 shots per game. The Euros had an average of 0.13 shots per possession, compared with 0.14 for the World Cup.
> **But the Euros look slightly stronger on two of the yardsticks**. Euro games averaged 160 successful passes in the final third, against 151 for the World Cup. And the Euros had a narrower average margin of victory, 1.23 goals, versus 1.33 in the World Cup.So 4/6 show little difference, while 2/6 show Euros ahead. But… really?

![](/views/assets/img/1*GDGzW0Iy85W0CCnADdS0rg.png)Here are the metrics compared. Positive differences are where Euros wins, negative where World Cup wins. World Cup 3–2 Euros is the scoreline. If you average the differences, Euros is up by a hair at 0.54% which, as noted, is not a significant difference.

A lot of this is quibbling about how the article’s thesis of “Euros > World Cup” is different than the analysis. The greater issue is that these metrics are ingrained into the sport of soccer. Exposing the individual quality of tournaments might not come down to these 6 metrics. As an example, here’s a 3rd competition as compared to the Euros and World Cups:

![](/views/assets/img/1*4-lPCboMojaLcsriKQC-pg.png)Some notable differences (Margin Of Victory and Goals), but shots and passes are pretty close. Overall, these lauded tournaments are only 6% “better” than this mystery competition. The sport of soccer does not have many noticeable differences when you’re looking at most counting metrics. Therefore, the article does not prove “there’s no difference between the World Cup and the Euros”, but instead does not make a case at all. Looking at team strength metrics (Elo, FIFA Rankings), player strength metrics (Wages, GoalImpact), and fan engagement to gauge how everyone rates the tournament. But sometimes the data available may be limited and perhaps that’s why the counting metrics were used.

That said, the article does end on a note I definitely agree with:


> Go ahead, watch them all.Enjoy all the soccer this summer! There’s plenty of it, and it’s all fun.

P.S. The mystery competition? **Major League Soccer.** Enjoy Americans, your league is not much worse than the World Cup. 😉
