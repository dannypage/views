  #### GoalNation is Built On Other People’s Uncredited Hard Work

![](/views/assets/img/1*Y69K2KRI_Ys4AW2lnmtd-A.png)[GoalNation](http://www.goalnation.com) and its Editor-In-Chief Diane Scavuzzo found themselves in trouble yesterday. The website purports itself to be “the leading digital youth soccer news publication in America.” But most of the site’s content is rapidly repackaged news releases, articles and photos copied without attribution from news organizations, or interviews that were not conducted by Scavuzzo. This was first brought to the soccer community’s attention by [Stephanie Yang](http://www.twitter.com/thrace) when she noticed something amiss with GoalNation’s interviews (More on that later).

![](/views/assets/img/1*3z_QYJQefIfGQF1Ak-hP0A.png)There are many entries on GoalNation are articles that have been completely lifted from other news organizations or soccer leagues. This [USMNT vs Jamaica](http://goalnation.com/gold-cup-upset-us-mnt-falls-to-jamaica/) Goal Cup upset recap was copied straight from the [US Soccer website](http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2015/07/22/19/59/150722-mnt-v-jam-gamestory) without attribution or link. Similarly, the [USWNT vs Ireland friendly](http://goalnation.com/uswnt-shut-out-republic-of-ireland/) recap can be also be found at [US Soccer.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiQv8SBpdjKAhVJkx4KHWpKCgYQFggdMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ussoccer.com%2Fstories%2F2016%2F01%2F24%2F00%2F37%2F160123-wnt-opens-2016-with-5-0-win-against-republic-of-ireland-in-front-of-record-crowd-in-san-diego&usg=AFQjCNE_w-oMy2YY1MR8-19uoKPFBn-1sQ&sig2=rp7ZtYAxJuXBWdUxI8BHIw) The [NWSL Weekend Recap](http://goalnation.com/nwsl-on-loan-weekend-recap/)? Word for word from the [NWSL’s official site.](http://www.nwslsoccer.com/News/2015Q4/902957.html) The announcement that [Pep Guardiola was going to MCFC](http://goalnation.com/manchester-city-guardiola-takes-pellegrinis-coach-spot/)? Plagarized from [The Telegraph’s Deadline Day liveblog](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city/12133958/Pep-Guardiola-to-take-over-at-Manchester-City-live.html#update-20160201-1536). There are many more examples of this; this is just a small selection.

Onto the issue of the problematic interviews: In this article about [Christen Westphal being drafted by the Boston Breakers](http://goalnation.com/interview-christen-westphal-boston-breakers/), the top half is PR straight from the [Boston Breakers](http://www.bostonbreakerssoccer.com/home/904422.html), then a series of interview questions. She was in the media scrum, but did not ask all the questions credited to her, especially not in a 1-on-1 environment.

> [](https://twitter.com/thrace/status/694281253533700098)Scavuzzo at first deflected the accusation:

![](/views/assets/img/1*YM2cE50W5aUHvcDXow27xQ.png)<https://twitter.com/thrace/status/694281926283268097>Finally, the article was changed to reflect that the questions were asked by intrepid interviewer “Questions” instead of “Diane Scavuzzo”, but only after being confronted. The [interview with Moya Dodd](http://goalnation.com/women-in-soccer-moya-dodd/) was also changed in a similar fashion. Scavuzzo was present for those interviews, but did not ask those questions herself.

However, was she present in [Portland for Caleb Porter’s extension?](http://goalnation.com/caleb-porter-intervew/)

Here is The Oregonian’s video interview with Caleb: [www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLqCK-PPgfg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLqCK-PPgfg). Click that, then read along with “her” interview:

![](/views/assets/img/1*svUCZkTwlXUSmFlSZB22FA.png)The Oregonian and its reporters likely won’t be pleased by their hard work being misrepresented as Scavuzzo’s work, which ultimately gets at the core issue: By continually erasing the hard work of others and writing her own name to that work, it only helps Scavuzzo and GoalNation while simultaneously keeping others down. It’s a darned shame to obfuscate the hard working journalists who sacrifice their time in order to cover the sport they love, often for little or no pay. Many, especially in WoSo, go to great personal costs in order to contribute to the sport. We must appreciate and reward that effort, not cheapen it like GoalNation has done.
