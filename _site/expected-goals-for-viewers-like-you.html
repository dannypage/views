    <p><strong>First off</strong>, thank you to everyone for all the wonderful compliments for my piece on <a href="https://medium.com/@dannypage/expected-goals-just-don-t-add-up-they-also-multiply-1dfd9b52c7d0">Expected Goals and Variance.</a> Not a single analytics brush fire was started either! (Perhaps I failed, then?) There have also been upgrades made to <a href="https://twitter.com/DTMAboutHeart">DTMAboutHockey’s xG Charts</a> to include xWin% and <a href="https://twitter.com/11tegen11">11tegen11’s xG Plots</a> include the Home/Away/Draw chances informed by the shots in the game. Great work by both, go check them out.</p>

<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, I’ve gotten data from <a href="http://twitter.com/bertinbertin">Michael Bertin</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/footballfactman">Paul Riley</a>. They’ve graciously provided their 2015 MLS and 2015/2016 EPL expected goals datasets. You can look up values on <a href="http://dannypage.github.io/lookup.html">your favorite players and teams</a>, and then copy these over to the <a href="http://dannypage.github.io/expected_season_goals.html">Longterm Expected Goals Simulator</a>.* (An automated link will be coming soon. There might be slight differences in each model’s shots and goal values, we’ll get that sorted soon as well.)*</p>

<p><strong>Thirdly</strong>, if you would like your model to be included, please shoot me an email (at the bottom of my site) or a <a href="https://twitter.com/dannypage">DM on twitter</a> and we can figure out a way to get your information easily available.</p>

<p>I’ll be offline most of this weekend, but hopefully you all will get a chance to check out the information that have been provided and gather some interesting insights. I’d love to see what you all find! “Enjoy” the International Break ;)</p>
