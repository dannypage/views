And although leaders of the Chanticleers crowing over their victory, it seems many South Carolinians may not even know what they had actually cheered for.</p>

<p>That confusion over what the win might mean for the Big South appears to have been reflected across the state on Thursday. Google reported sharp upticks in searches not only related to the competition but also about basic questions concerning the teams involved. At about 5 p.m. Eastern time, about one hour after the game ended, Google reported that searches for ‚Äúwhat is coastal carolina‚Äù had more than tripled.</p>

<p>But despite the all-out attempts by either side to court baseball fans, Cleers were not only mystified by what would happen if they won the C.W.S‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämany seemed not to even know what Coastal Carolina is.</p>

<p>What is Coastal Carolina? To be fair, that question will now take on a much deeper significance than perhaps Google‚Äôs users realized when they typed that into their browsers.</p>
