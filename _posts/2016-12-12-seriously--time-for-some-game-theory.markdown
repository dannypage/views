  A short description of Game Theory and why it matters. Includes examples about the Prisoner’s Dilemma, Gas Stations that are too close, and more.   Perhaps you’ve seen a thread going around Twitter today that claims to invoke game theory to explain the political climate of the day. And like a certain movie whose premise is founded on game theory, it never fully shows a real example of game theory. This has lead to plenty of people wondering… **What is Game Theory?**

![](/img/1*plf4BC1FJX6a0hfyG9oJ3A.gif)buckle inAt the core, Game Theory studies the interactions between people, countries, teams, and other (hopefully) rational decision-makers. It has applications in games, business, trade, and politics. We intuitively make these decisions all the time that involve imperfect information against an opponent. For example: anytime you had to decide if an opponent was bluffing in poker? Yup, you ‘did’ Game Theory!

It has been expanded upon into a full field of study by various academics. [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann "John von Neumann"), [John Nash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash "John Forbes Nash") (Portrayed in ‘A Beautiful Mind’), [Lloyd Shapley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Shapley "Lloyd Shapley"), and many others. The field generalized the examples into mathematical equations that end up being out of the scope of this article. But let’s get to the good stuff. Here are a few examples of Game Theory:

#### The classic example — The Prisoner’s Dilemma

What happens when two people need to coordinate their actions, but can’t talk to each other? Well, it requires a lot of trust in the other player, especially when the payoff can be bigger if they betray them. If you don’t also betray them as well.

#### Why are gas stations, hotels, and fast food places so close together?

Ever notice a CVS right next to a Rite-Aid? Or a Lowe’s not far from a Home Depot? Why is that? Well, in a perfectly organized society (like my last SimCity save), resources are efficiently distributed. But we are dealing with people who are driven by profit and weak agreements. Here’s an example fo [*Hotelling’s law*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotelling%27s_law "Hotelling's law")*.*

This can also apply to politicians on the political spectrum as well. Bernie Sanders forced Hillary Clinton to move her positions to the left a bit in order to keep some undecided liberal voters that she was ceding ground to. This is also why you’ll hear that a politician has to “move to the center” for the general election. [More on that here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7SgM2-Codg)

#### Survivorship Bias

Should you read that self-help book? Or what can we gather by a plane that returns from battle? Sometimes, the information they convey is not as important as the information lost by those who can’t make a case. You can learn more about success by studying the weakened, the bankrupt, or the dead. How is that? Survivorship Bias can hide the element of luck in one’s survival. Or perhaps the information needed is hidden among the wreckage. We learn more about flight from a black box, than we do from a plane that lands successfully. For more on that, check out this article from the You Are Not So Smart folks:
