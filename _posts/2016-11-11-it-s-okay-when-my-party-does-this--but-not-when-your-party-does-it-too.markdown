  #### Many times we try to catch pundits in a trap. I’m not sure it works.


> They said X about Y when they did Z, but said Not-X about Not-Y when THEY did Z! What a hypocrite!Does that convince anyone? Does that ever work? I don’t think it does, other than to signal something to people who think similarly. And it gets plenty of RTs. But it doesn’t seem like it shames the person into correcting their hypocritical statement. I do think the Joe Freedom Walsh “Protest Is Good, Except My Guy Won”, or Donald Trump’s “The Electoral College is Bad, Until I Won” are obviously hypocritical pairs of statements. But what to do with it? Trump is still President.

![](/img/1*tAusPbMGkOl6BeAWY17zmQ.jpeg)I mean, he’s totally wrong. But I don’t think he’s gonna see this and change his mind.Another instance of this was when I had a reaction to [NBA players potentially not visiting the White House during the Trump presidency.](http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/11/jalen-rose-nba-players-white-house-donald-trump-president) And I understand and support that stance. I bet a lot of people will not feel comfortable meeting this new president. (Or downright terrified by him) But then I realized I was mad when Tim Thomas refused to go to the White House, when… looking back, [he wasn’t all that disrespectful about it.](https://www.nhl.com/news/thomas-statement-on-white-house-absence/c-613279) And if he is consistent, Thomas probably wouldn’t go to a Trump White House either. And I’m sure there will be some sports folks that would give that future NBA team grief, but may have supported Tim Thomas. (A long gap between those instances and those two leagues, but I’m sure they are out there.) Does it help to compare screenshots of those people? Probably not. But again, great for retweets.

Maybe all I’m asking is that we make clear what our values are when we find a person that potentially flip-flopped. I have fallen to this; it’s how I’m now blocked by [Jamelle Bouie](https://twitter.com/jbouie) for thinking I caught him in a trap regarding how open primaries should be to voters. (The tweet is now gone, as I do remove older tweets, but I am sorry for being a jerk.) Bringing out his tweets from 2012 didn’t help, and backfired. He didn’t listen to my argument, as I really didn’t have one. So I don’t fault him for blocking me. I think I got some retweets though.

Maybe I should have approached the statement at face value. **If a statement is ultimately wrong, it should be wrong regardless of what the person had said in the past.** Strangely enough, Trump was incorrect before, but correct now. And back to players refusing to go to the White House, I now believe that’s fine too. The act of going to the White House is a privilege, but it’s not the duty of the person. And now that we’ve finally come around to the idea of sports-is-politics-all-the-time, I’m sure it’s going to happen more often as a political act. Time to get used to it.

I’ll end with a bit from an [essay from the PopeHat website](https://popehat.com/2016/11/09/getting-back-to-work-the-day-after/) that stuck out to me this week:


> We must be prepared to fight against policies that conflict with our values. But that requires, first, some soul-searching about what those values are, whether we have already compromised them, and whether we have been effective and credible advocates for them. [..] It may be a little late to speak out for them if we stood by while “our team” demeaned them. But as I believe in grace and redemption, I believe in the possibility of a renewed commitment to values and a new fight for them.We must know our values, as only then we can fight for them. It can’t be “My party good, your party bad” as that will get us nowhere. Neither will “You flip-flopped!”. Again, nowhere. Instead, seriously think on them and then attack them head-on. Debate the merits. In order to win the fight for our values, we are going to need more than John Oliver videos, screenshots, and retweets.

#### Random Asides:

* The tradition of champions going to the White House isn’t that old. Reagan appears to have been the one to really kick it off. Reminds me of flag pins and poppies: things that were once rare, but now seem to be obligatory. <https://www.quora.com/When-did-the-tradition-of-Championship-teams-coming-to-the-White-House-begin>
* This Bleacher Report article is fascinating. It calls out Tim Thomas for not going, using arguments that have also thrown at Kaepernick lately. <http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1037288-tim-thomas-the-ugly-truth-behind-his-white-house-refusal>
