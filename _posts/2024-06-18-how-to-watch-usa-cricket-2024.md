USA Cricket is on it's way to the Super 8. Not the motel, but instead the next round of the Men's T20 Cricket World Cup. They finished second in their group with wins over Canada and Pakistan, a close loss to India, and a washout game against Ireland. This granted them 5 points and a berth into the next round. They'll go on to face South Africa, West Indies (Known as the Windies), and England. Two wins in this round-robin group would likely be enough to see them through to the semi-finals.

Let's say you've never seen a game of cricket before, where do you even start to understand this cousin of baseball? Here are a few terms to start:

- Runs: Like in baseball, the goal of the game is to score the most runs possible. In baseball, you have to round all 4 bases to score a run. In cricket, you merely have to run 20 meters to the other side of the Pitch to score a run. If you hit the ball out of the field, it's 4 runs if it bounced on the way out, 6 runs if it clears the boundary before landing.
- Wicket: This when is when the batter is out. In baseball, a batter would get to go again after getting out. In cricket, once you get out, you are done for the match. You get 10 wickets before your team is done playing offense. You can get out if the ball is caught before bouncing, the ball hits the stumps (also called a wicket) on delivery, or hits the stump before you reach the other side of the pitch.
- Overs: This divides up the innings. The bowling team delivers (pitches) 6 balls per Over. There are 20 Overs per side in T20 cricket (hence the name). ODI - One Day International - has 50 Overs per side. Once you've exhausted all the overs, your team is done batting.
- Innings: Each team gets 1 of these in T20 cricket. (Why is it plural then? Who can say.)

So, to bring it all together, __when your team bats first, you want them to score as many runs as possible in 20 Overs before you have 10 Wickets.__ If your team is batting second, your team is __chasing the target__ set by the first team. And that's it! Let's break down a few scorelines to understand why there are fractions.
