  ![](/img/1*XGz8SNS1nrVtt6cS-bhNWA.jpeg)Ally Kasun could be a sneaky pickup in this week’s draft — photo: [news-press.com](http://www.news-press.com/story/sports/college/fgcu/2015/11/04/tiny-tenacious-ally-kasun-heart-fgcu-womens-soccer/75158168/)Quick article here so I can get a few ideas on record before the NWSL College Draft on Friday. (Hope to see people there!)

This uses [Christopher Long’s](http://twitter.com/octonion) [ratings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QdIQh8GRrx3h08E0Leimecr2e0CNPXQUuCF2k6sGxIw/edit?usp=sharing) to find some potentially overlooked players where their team’s Offense or Defense Rating is much better than their overall rating. They may not be the top players at their positions, but players who may not have gotten a first glance because their teams weren’t in the national tournament, making them great late round or undrafted selections.

For example: Jackie Kerestine’s North Texas was ranked 26 in Long’s rankings, but had the 10th best Defense Rating. She played 95% of the last two seasons as well and broke many records during her tenure there, so she is definitely worth looking into.

Def/Off/Overall all refer to Long’s rankings; NCAA is the ranking at the end of the 2015 season. Each player has been linked to their bio on their respective school site.
