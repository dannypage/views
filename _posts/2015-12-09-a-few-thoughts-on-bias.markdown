title:	"A Few Thoughts on Bias"

  Every now and then, a few moments in a day line up perfectly to show you something that you may have been missing prior. This started out as a thing about bias of who is included in the “analytics movement”, but as it goes sometimes: Once you notice something, you see it everywhere. Here’s a few examples from just the last six hours.

First, an interactive simulator about [bias in the workplace](http://doesgenderbiasmatter.com/) by [Penelope Hill](https://twitter.com/penelopecodes). She uses “Men & Women” as the example based on some research, but it also could apply in different amounts based on race or other factors. In the picture below, even a 1% bias towards Men results in a large disparity at the CEO level. 5% or 10% is even more striking.

Smith about the 76ers and Analytics](http://espn.go.com/espnradio/play?id=14324312) leads to a bad possibility in future hiring, given that “who you know is as important as what you know”:


> Bomani: Is there anything going down the line, because it seems that this is a kind of theme, a lot of these hedge fund guys are buying teams, getting these general managers who really looked at this in kinda a cold sorta way, players are just assets and trying to figure out how to get to the long run goal. Is there any effect on how this is gonna go and how the league proceeds across the league?
> SAS: Here’s the direction it’s going in. We’re going to see less and less black coaches. **Because I ask you a question, albeit rhetorically, you tell me what black guy you know associated with analytics.** Show ’em to me, because I don’t know who it is. I talk to coaches all the time; I can’t find one African-American associated with MIT and analytics and all of this stuff, employed by Billy Beane, baseball, and Daryl Morey and these boys in basketball. They seem to be hiring guys they are familiar with who believes in their analytic approach, their numbers approach, and the owners are not going to get in the way because it’s making them money, not costing them money; maybe because they don’t have to pay as much for players, pay as much for coaches, and they don’t have to pay as much for executives who are doing the numbers crunching, plus those spreadsheets are the language that the owners understand because they are billionaires and pay more attention to numbers than they are to talent. All of those things combined speaks to the fact that you will see less and less black coaches getting hired to coach 80% of the black players in the league because the coaches and the executives are hand-in-hand busy numbers crunching, analyzing, and dissecting the game of basketball.
> Bomani: You don’t have to ask me rhetorically; you gotta remember, I got graduate degree in economics and business — I know who was and was not in those classes. That was always a big thing, **we don’t really train black people to do math and science work and now it manifests itself in sports.**
> SAS: How’d it feel to be the only black person in your class?
> Bomani: I have stories, I have very interesting stories. *chuckles*Thirdly, biases in social media. SI has very few women’s teams are mentioned in their best social media accounts, and US Soccer’s account has a similar lack of promotion.

This case is challenging Affirmative Action that’s in use to help minorities get into school and correct the biases that currently exist in our society. It’s a shame that the Justices don’t recognize those biases also exist within the Supreme Court:

And these are just the few of those that people experience every day in America. I didn’t even touch Donald Trump and the garbage that spews out of this mouth, but remember that his hateful rhetoric has a direct effect on people as well.

Here’s my takeaway from the examples today and the many others I’ve seen in the past:


> Challenge systems. Embrace diversity. Seek out new voices. If you get called out, don’t get defensive, but instead listen.I’m likely going to fail at this so please call me out when I do. Fellow white men (I’m aware that most of the people that read this will fit that category), I challenge you to do the same. Our actions matter more than our words or promises.

Sports Analytics is the process of challenging systems held back by out-dated biases. Let’s expand that to our society as well.
