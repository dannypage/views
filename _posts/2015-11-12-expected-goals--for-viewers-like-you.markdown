  **First off**, thank you to everyone for all the wonderful compliments for my piece on [Expected Goals and Variance.](https://medium.com/@dannypage/expected-goals-just-don-t-add-up-they-also-multiply-1dfd9b52c7d0) Not a single analytics brush fire was started either! (Perhaps I failed, then?) There have also been upgrades made to [DTMAboutHockey’s xG Charts](https://twitter.com/DTMAboutHeart) to include xWin% and [11tegen11’s xG Plots](https://twitter.com/11tegen11) include the Home/Away/Draw chances informed by the shots in the game. Great work by both, go check them out.

**Secondly**, I’ve gotten data from [Michael Bertin](http://twitter.com/bertinbertin) and [Paul Riley](http://twitter.com/footballfactman). They’ve graciously provided their 2015 MLS and 2015/2016 EPL expected goals datasets. You can look up values on [your favorite players and teams](http://dannypage.github.io/lookup.html), and then copy these over to the [Longterm Expected Goals Simulator](http://dannypage.github.io/expected_season_goals.html).* (An automated link will be coming soon. There might be slight differences in each model’s shots and goal values, we’ll get that sorted soon as well.)*

**Thirdly**, if you would like your model to be included, please shoot me an email (at the bottom of my site) or a [DM on twitter](https://twitter.com/dannypage) and we can figure out a way to get your information easily available.

I’ll be offline most of this weekend, but hopefully you all will get a chance to check out the information that have been provided and gather some interesting insights. I’d love to see what you all find! “Enjoy” the International Break ;)
